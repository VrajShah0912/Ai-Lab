Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. It was initially designed to support Bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain is composed of a series of blocks, each containing transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. This structure ensures data integrity across the network. Public blockchains are open to everyone, while private blockchains restrict access to selected participants. Blockchain offers decentralization, removing the need for a central authority. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts coded onto the blockchain. They automatically enforce the terms of an agreement. Ethereum is a popular platform for smart contract development. In supply chain management, blockchain improves transparency and traceability. It is also used in healthcare for secure medical record sharing. Blockchain ensures voting systems are tamper-proof and verifiable. Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are digital assets secured on a blockchain. Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake ensure agreement across blockchain networks. Proof of Work requires solving complex puzzles, while Proof of Stake selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency held. Blockchain scalability remains a major challenge. Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network aim to improve transaction speed and reduce costs. Privacy concerns have led to developments like Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Governments are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies using blockchain technology. Although blockchain is secure, 51% attacks remain a potential risk. Blockchain is revolutionizing finance, supply chains, and even voting systems. Understanding its concepts is crucial for participating in the digital economy.
